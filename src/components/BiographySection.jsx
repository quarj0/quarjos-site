            Before starting my career in tech, I was a student passionate about
            computers and technology. Although I initially had the interest to
            pursue oil engineering at university, my interest in cybersecurity
            and software development led me to self-learn programming languages
            and explore web development, software creation, and IT support. Over
            time, I built a strong foundation in computer science, gaining
            hands-on experience and continuously expanding my skills in the
            dynamic tech industry.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base">
            I specialize in backend development for web applications and
            software. I have hands-on experience building web applications using
            the <strong>Django</strong> framework and <strong>ReactJS</strong>
            library. My expertise includes developing RESTful APIs, web
            services, and managing databases. I am proficient in working with
            databases such as <strong>PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite</strong>.
            Additionally, I have solid experience using{" "}
            <strong>Git for version control</strong>
            and working with the <strong>Linux operating system.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base">
            I hold IBM certifications in cybersecurity, including
            the <strong>IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate</strong>, <strong>Database
            Essentials</strong> from the University of Colorado, and <strong>System Security</strong>
            by ISC2. I am currently pursuing the <strong>CySA+</strong> and <strong>Google IT Support
            Certifications</strong>. These certifications have equipped me with
            expertise in cybersecurity principles, network security, incident
            response, and IT support. I am skilled in troubleshooting hardware
            and software issues, providing technical assistance, and resolving
            complex IT problems. With a solid grasp of computer networks,
            operating systems, and security protocols, I am committed to staying
            updated with the latest technologies in the evolving tech industry.
