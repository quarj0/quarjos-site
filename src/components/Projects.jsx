              Developed an all-in-one research platform designed to empower
              knowledge sharing and innovation. The hub features a diverse range
              of resources, including blogs for insightful research discussions,
              an events calendar for upcoming academic conferences and webinars,
              and a collection of curated materials to support research efforts.
              This platform is designed to keep researchers informed and engaged
              with the latest trends in their field. Additionally, the hub
              offers valuable opportunities for research funding, including
              grants to support academic projects, and an IT training section to
              equip researchers with essential technological skills. By
              combining resources, events, funding, and training, this platform
              is a powerful tool for driving academic and professional growth in

              Developed a system analyzer tool that provides a comprehensive
              overview for measuring system response times, checking OS updates,
              monitoring system metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage, and
              network traffic, as well as conducting network speed tests.
              Designed for IT professionals, system administrators, and
              developers, the tool offers a user-friendly interface with
              real-time data visualization and detailed reports. By providing
              valuable insights into system performance and network
              connectivity, the system analyzer tool helps users optimize their
              systems for peak performance and reliability. The tool is
              compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems,
              making it a versatile solution for monitoring and analyzing system
              performance across different platforms.

              users to perform various banking operations, such as checking
              account balances, transferring funds, and withdrawing cash using
              their fingerprint for authentication. The simulator features a
              user-friendly interface with interactive screens for navigating
              through different banking functions. By incorporating
              fingerprint-based authentication, the application offers enhanced
              security and convenience for users. The simulator is designed to
              replicate the functionality of a real ATM machine, providing a
              hands-on experience for users to practice their banking skills
              safely and securely. This project was developed using Java
              programming language and MySQL database and was part of software
              engineering course that I helped a team of student to develop.
